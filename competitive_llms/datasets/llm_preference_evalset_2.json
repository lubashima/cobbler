{"instruction": "Why do we dismiss the idea of life on a planet just because nothing on earth could live on it?", "reference": "No, we don't dismiss planets, or even moons of planets because nothing on Earth could survive there. \n\nWe do know a couple things about how life formed on the Earth and tend to think you need the same things for life to form anywhere else. Water is an important thing. The reason we look for planets with water is that water is an incredible solvent. That means it can break big things into little things given enough time. \n\nWater also means that the little things get mixed up with other little things and can bond with them. Free flowing water allows for more mixing. Hydrogen is common in the Universe. It is the stuff stars come from. Oxygen can come about in the right conditions, so water is not that uncommon. Comets even carry water and there is even an argument amongst science guys as to where the water on Earth came from. Some think from those comets one drop at a time. \n\nLiquid water being a good solvent and a good mixing bowl means that the things that are needed to make life had a good chance of interacting. \n\nWe know approximately how far away from a star liquid water should be found. We also know what it would take to keep a planet-like sphere warm enough to keep the water liquid. We don't know what it would take to keep the mixing pot working in a gas giant. Simply, there doesn't seem to be a way to get the pieces to stay together long enough erode enough in a planet that does not have liquid water.

{"instruction": "Why do bugs/moths flock to light at night?", "reference": "There are several theories, but honestly this is something no one's quite sure about. The one that I like best is that many nocturnal insects use the moon for navigation. They do this by keeping their flight path at a constant angle relative to the moon. Since the moon is so far away, it effectively \"anchors\" their flight so that they can fly in a straight line.\n\nNow, imagine you're a moth. You see a bright artificial light but to you, it's just as much of a navigational anchor as the moon. So you try to keep it at the same angle relative to your flight path...but of course, the closer you get to it, the more it seems to move relative to you. You have to keep over-correcting to keep it at the same angle. From the moth's perspective, it's doing what it always does--flying while keeping the moon in front of it and slightly overhead. To an outside observer, the moth ends up spiraling endlessly around/toward the light source. This may be why bugs sometimes circle lights instead of flying straight at them.\n\nThat doesn't explain why, for instance, a bug might fly up to a light and land near it instead of circling it, or why some moths will fly straight into a bug zapper, but that's where a lot of other theories come in. For instance, there's a theory that artificial light suggests a wide-open space for flight.\n\nHonestly, it's probably a variety of reasons...maybe some insects are attracted because of the navigational spiraling effect and the rest come to prey on the others.\n\n(A great youtube video that explains this far better than I: _URL_0_)\n\ntl;dr No one knows."}
{"instruction": "Why does American TV look different from British TV?", "reference": "A pretty solid answer to this was given by another Redditor a few years back. Here's what he said.\n\n > There seems to be a lot of bouncing around the subject here. Here's the most concise and complete answers I can give you. I'm a Brit, and I have a degree in this shit.\nFirst off I have no idea why Canadian TV looks different. I've never seen any. Here's the difference between American and British TV.\nTechnology\nAmerican television uses an encoding system called \"NTSC,\" which stands for \"National Television System Committee.\" British TV uses a system called PAL. This stands for \"Phase Alternating Line.\" There's your first difference: they both encode colour differently so they can wire it to your TV. For more information, check the \"Colo(u)r encoding\" sections of the NTSC and PAL Wikipedia pages.\nLet\u2019s get something out of the way first. Television around the world uses a method of displaying images called \"interlacing.\" Interlacing splits your screen into two sets of lines that show different pictures. One set of lines shows one picture, and the other shows another. They change over the second like this shitty MS Paint illustration.\nLook at the first set of lines. Imagine you're watching the episode of Happy Days where the Fonz jumps a shark. The red lines show an image of Fonzie just as he's started the jump. The blue lines show him a little higher off the water. Then the green lines in the next \"half-frame\" show him a little higher. And the cyan ones in the next frame show him a little higher than that. And so on. Essentially, the images change into each other, instead of just whole image / whole image / whole image. As you can imagine, an actual picture -- let's say the one represented by the red lines in the illustration -- lasts for two \"half-frames\", so one image is a \"full frame.\"\nAmerican and British TV uses a different number of half-frames a second. American TVs show 60 of them, made out of 30 images, while British TVs show 50, made out of 25 images. Hence American TV's refresh rate is 60Hz and British TV's is 50Hz -- that's how many times a second the electronics in your TV needs to scream at the screen to change its image. So American TVs have more frames per second. It's not actually 30, it's more like 29.97, but for the purposes of this explanation I'm sure nobody cares.\nFinally, the number of lines per half-frame. American TV splits the screen into 480 lines, and British TV splits it into 576. British \"standard definition\" is a little higher-res than American.\nIf you add a slightly lower resolution to more frames per second, American TV ought to appear \"smoother\" than British TV. Add that to a different colour-encoding method and you've got a reasonably different image.\nWhen you watch PAL British TV on an NTSC American TV, you\u2019ll be watching something that was recorded for 25 frames per second split into 576 lines, on a TV designed for showing 30 frames per second split into 480. When a programme from the UK is shown in the US, or vice-versa, it has to go through some conversion processes so that it will show in the American TV sets. This will give it a slightly different look as well.\nProduction\nAmerican TV has more money to throw about. More shows are shot on film or high-quality digital video. This gives it a different look to cheap video. Cheaper video has a lot less \u201cdynamic range,\u201d which means it can only capture a small range of \u201cbrightnesses\u201d and \u201cdarknesses.\u201d While there\u2019s plenty of American shows shot on video, there are much more shot on British -- and remember, as we\u2019ve said already both our video formats look different.\nOn top of that I genuinely believe that Americans know how to shoot film and television better than the British, but that\u2019s simply my opinion.  \n\n[Source](_URL_0_)"}

{"instruction": "Why is the concept of DRM on video games so heated?", "reference": "Steam is absolutely DRM. A lot of the people involved in the furor with Microsoft's DRM stance aren't necessarily against DRM, though they say they are; they're against DRM that prevents ease of use.\n\nSpecifically, Steam is a very easy piece of DRM to work with, and it has a number of benefits. Sign in, and not only will it let you play your games, it'll help install them and keep them up-to-date. And, if you don't have an Internet connection, you can go into Offline mode and keep playing.\n\nThe issue with the way Microsoft was going to use DRM was that it required the console to regularly connect to the Internet. A lot of the time, that just isn't an option- soldiers overseas might want to play games and have power for it, but not have a good enough connection for their Xbox to phone home.\n\nThis is especially an issue when you consider the key benefits of having a console over a PC: convenience and freedom from hassle. I should be able to play a game on my console as long as I have power, regardless of other circumstances. With the way Microsoft was going, that might not be an option.\n\nMicrosoft's reversal means that although for a majority of people, the gaming experience will be \"worse\"- i.e., having to insert a disc every time you want to play a game - it'll be consistent for more people, which is staying true to the fundamental tradeoff of using a console versus using a PC."}

{"instruction": "why does spectral leaks occur when doing fft?", "reference": "The sampled signal does not fully represent the real world underlying signal. Critically, in this case, the sampled signal is recorded for a finite time. \n\nLet's imagine a single sine wave at a given frequency. Its analytic Fourier transform will contain a delta spike at that frequency and nowhere else. But when you take an FFT of a finite domain signal, you apply a windowing function. If you choose no windowing function, you get a rectangular window by default. \n\nYou can say that the measured signal is your original perfect (infinite) sine wave multiplied by a function that equals 1 during the sampling window and 0 everywhere else. That's the rectangular window. Since this multiplication occurs in the time domain, there must be a convolution in the frequency domain. \n\nThis convolution is a good way to picture the leakage. Take the Fourier of the sine wave, and you get a spike. Take the Fourier of the rectangular function, and you get a sinc wave, which is periodic and peaks at the center and decays with distance. Now convolve these two transformed functions in the frequency domain by sliding the sinc function over the spike. This blurs out the spike, and you get your leaky FFT."}
