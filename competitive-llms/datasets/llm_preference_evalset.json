Your body is a natural conductor, and can conduct electricity. Your body absorbs and can pass on electrical currents and direct them into the antenna.\n\nTrust me on this, I work for the telephone company and we use this as a way to trace phone lines all the time. Its called induction.\n\nYour body, when you touch the antenna, becomes part of the antenna and can do 1 of 2 things. 1, it can help by removing and grounding out certain unneeded signals temporarily. By providing a path to ground, the EM frequencies are being grounded out and thereby eliminating interference by allowing the signals that you are trying to see, to be stronger than the ones you are trying to ignore. The 2nd thing, is that when you touch the antenna, your body extends the antennas surface area by a degree, and instead of the thin metal wires being the only conductors, it now uses you to catch and route signal to the antenna.\n\nIn essence, either way, when you touch it you become part of the conductor itself."}, {"instruction": "Could Godzilla have been killed by the Tohoku earthquake?", "reference": "No. The Tohoku earthquake led to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant meltdown.

If I'm  not mistaken, both Dresser Wayne and Gilbarco (two of the big manufacturers) make them, and have made them for a while. They have several notable drawbacks.\n\nAutomatic Cash Acceptors, ACAs, are both unreliable and inaccurate. Everyone has dealt with them in things like soda machines. They take bills without giving credit, give back incorrect change, and jam up regularly. All of these issues add overhead costs for the gas station and royally piss off customers.\n\nACA's require frequent cash refills and empties. ATM's are refilled by armed guards, which are very expensive and are usually billed by the minute for their time, armored truck time, and driver time. A gas station full of ACAs would require daily service from a security company, which again adds overhead costs for the gas station.\n\nACA's are big targets for theft. A lone ATM is already a pretty high risk, and has many security features built in to deter theft. If you put 8-10 ACA's in a single gas station lot, you run a much higher risk of theft.\n\nACA's by their very nature lose the gas station money. Gas stations make almost all their profits from customers coming into the store and buying drinks and whatnot. Customers paying cash at the pump reduces that profit.\n\nSo an ACA upsets customers, costs a lot of money, and creates a higher risk of theft and property damage.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-"}, {"instruction": "Was Augustus his real name?", "reference": "No. Augustus was given the name Gaius Octavius at birth.
